# TodoMVC app using React.js+Swarm.js combo

This demo is a showcase for key features of the [Swarm
library](https://github.com/gritzko/swarm):

* isomorphic js (node.js server part does full page render)
* real-time sync (open the exact same page in two tabs/browsers)
* offline work (turn the internet off, then load the page :) )
* caching (work offline, close the browser, open when online)

Step by step: 

    git clone https://github.com/gritzko/todomvc-swarm
    cd todomvc-swarm
    npm install
    npm start

...then open it http://localhost:8000/SomeTodoName

There is a blog post introducing the demo:
